# SFND_Unscented_Kalman_Filter
Sensor Fusion UKF Highway Project Starter Code

<img src="media/ukf_highway_tracked.gif" width="700" height="400" />

In this project you will implement an Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate the state of multiple cars on a highway using noisy lidar and radar measurements. Passing the project requires obtaining RMSE values that are lower that the tolerance outlined in the project rubric. 

The main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ukf_highway

Note that the programs that need to be written to accomplish the project are src/ukf.cpp, and src/ukf.h

The program main.cpp has already been filled out, but feel free to modify it.

<img src="media/ukf_highway.png" width="700" height="400" />

`main.cpp` is using `highway.h` to create a straight 3 lane highway environment with 3 traffic cars and the main ego car at the center. 
The viewer scene is centered around the ego car and the coordinate system is relative to the ego car as well. The ego car is green while the 
other traffic cars are blue. The traffic cars will be accelerating and altering their steering to change lanes. Each of the traffic car's has
it's own UKF object generated for it, and will update each indidual one during every time step. 

The red spheres above cars represent the (x,y) lidar detection and the purple lines show the radar measurements with the velocity magnitude along the detected angle. The Z axis is not taken into account for tracking, so you are only tracking along the X/Y axis.

## Other Important Dependencies
* cmake >= 3.5
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
 * PCL 1.2

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./ukf_highway`

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) as much as possible.

## Generating Additional Data

This is optional!

If you'd like to generate your own radar and lidar modify the code in `highway.h` to alter the cars. Also check out `tools.cpp` to
change how measurements are taken, for instance lidar markers could be the (x,y) center of bounding boxes by scanning the PCD environment
and performing clustering. This is similar to what was done in Sensor Fusion Lidar Obstacle Detection.

## Constant turn rate and velocity magnitude model (CTRV) 
In order to experiment and understand different motion models, the course exhibited different motion models for object tracking, all of them provided different advantages and disadvatages depending on the application.

For the Unscented Kalman Filter project the CTRV model was selected. Our prior model the Constant Velocity (CV) model provided good results in different scenarios; however, by making this assumption we simplify a lot the way the tracked object moves, as it also take turns.

On the other hand, the CTVR model assumes that objects can move not only on straight line but they can also move at a constant turn rate with a constant velocity magnitude. By using this model we will have more accuracy in the motion prediction of the desired object

The CTRV now provides a 5 dimensional vector state. Which considers the object position in the cartesian plane (Px, Py), the Velocity magnitude (V), the Yaw angle and the Yaw rate.
